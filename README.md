# A data aggregation challenge where the goal is use the summer.csv file which contains the list of all individual medal winners from the first olympics all the way up to 2012 and derive the official medal tables for each edition. Since some of the events are mixed gender and team events, a simple agrouping by year, country, and medal well overcount the number of medals since the winner of a team event gets only 1 medal in the official medal table rather than 1 medal for each team member. The challenge is to use given information about which events are mixed and designating team events as ones with more than 5 medals awarded to derive the true medal tables
